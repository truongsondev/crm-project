   <img src="./public/form_login.png" alt="form login" width="500"/>
</p>

Next, when the user clicks the submit button, the client will send an HTTP request containing the **username** and **password** in the request body.

Upon receiving the request, the server extracts the username and password from `request.body`.

The server then looks up the username in the database. If the username exists, it compares the password sent by the user with the one stored in the database. If the passwords match, the server generates a private key and a public key, then uses the key pair to sign the access token and refresh token using the `RS256 algorithm.`

Finally, the server responds to the client with the user information and the token pair.

When the client receives the response from the server, it stores the user information in local storage and saves the token pair in cookies.  
The access token has an expiration time of **2 days**, while the refresh token expires in **7 days**.
